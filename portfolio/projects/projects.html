      <p><strong>Title: Squishy Squish</strong><br><br>Date of Project: April 2023 <br><br> As a team, we made a infinite jumping platformer game. We implemented a shop for power-ups using redux for state management and p5 for the physics. The power-ups could stack and would change the jump height or movement speed of our character. We created a leaderboard that could be updated with high scores. Coins could be collected to spend in the store and make the game move slower. We created sprites but these were never implemented. Making p5 work with react and redux was extremely difficult and I would be keen to try phaser next time as an alternative. From what I have seen, sprites are also much easier to implement in Phaser than in p5, so it would be exciting to try this project again but in Phaser.

      <p><strong>Title: Full Stack To Do List</strong><br><br>Date of Project: April 2023<br><br> One of your challenges during bootcamp was to create a full stack to-do list. We used RESTful APIs and a SQLite database. This challenge really helped to solidify my learning in terms of how APIs work by connecting the front-end to the back-end database. This was also the first app I officially deployed. We used dokku to do this through a Dev Academy Account, so please be warned that the deployment will not last forever.

  <p><strong>Title: Hit the Button</strong><br><br>Date of Project: March 2023 <br><br> During bootcamp, a few of my peers and I were talking about projects we wanted to work on. One peer said he wanted to create a push the button game, but doubted we had learnt enough to do it. So another peer and I decided to give it a go. Since we had learnt about event handlers and onclick, I figured we had enough knowledge to create a basic version of the game. It used HTML, CSS and JS. Being able to create this really showed to me how much we had learnt in such a short amount of time and even though projects can seem daunting, breaking the task down makes it a lot easier.
