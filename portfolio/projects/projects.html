      <p><strong>Title: Squishy Squish</strong><br><br>Date of Project: April 2023 <br><br> As a team, we made a infinite jumping platformer game. We implemented a shop for power-ups using redux for state management and p5 for the physics. The power-ups could stack and would change the jump height or movement speed of our character. We created a leaderboard that could be updated with high scores. Coins could be collected to spend in the store and make the game move slower. We created sprites but these were never implemented. Making p5 work with react and redux was extremely difficult and I would be keen to try phaser next time as an alternative. From what I have seen, sprites are also much easier to implement in Phaser than in p5, so it would be exciting to try this project again but in Phaser.</p>
